Booj's Book List is a take home project given to me by Remax/Booj. 

## Task

The task was as follows: 

* Create a books API using Laravel
* Create a Nativescript Vue app that allows the user to
* Add or remove books from the list
* Change the order of the books in the list
* Sort the list of books by their author 
* Display a book detail page with a minimum of author, publication date, and title 
* Include unit tests
* Deploy it on the cloud - be prepared to describe your process on deployment
